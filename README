Geo::Point
===========

Geo::Point tries to abstract coordinate systems.  It does not try
to solve all the problems itself, but will call-out for helper
modules when computation has to be done.

The module is havily resting on Math::Polygon.

***** This module is only in an BETA development state... it is
***** currently only used with wgs84, so all transformations have
***** not been tested!!!

Improvements and additions please to
